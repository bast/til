# Start Jupyter notebook without opening the browser

```
$ jupyter-notebook --no-browser
```

Then you can decide which browser to use, instead of Jupyter opening one for you:
```
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/user/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-229705-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=2d1912db6be1a23f6777542eb1d08f967e9a2ff40e6ec5ab
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=2d1912db6be1a23f6777542eb1d08f967e9a2ff40e6ec5ab
```
